Read about the following commands:

CREATE TABLE ...;

INSERT INTO ...;

SELECT FROM ...;

UPDATE table SET field_name = 'value' WHERE id = 123;

DELETE FROM table_name WHERE id = 123;


HOME WORK:

    1.  Create Two *Related* tables perhaps similar to the django polls app models:
        https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/intro/tutorial01/

    2.  INSERT data into both including the foreign key relationships.

    3.  Use JOIN, ON to SELECT from both tables at once. See example file.

    4.  Augment that query to add WHERE, ORDER. Again see example file.

    5.  EXTRA CREDIT: Keep going to Use GROUP BY and HAVING. Not in example but ample resources exist.
