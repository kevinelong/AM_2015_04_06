# The idea is that one could go to a tab that held situations, ie 'anger' or 'age regression' and kick back
# 5-7 phrases that are most likely to change the situation. For example, if you clicked 'Fear', a response might
# be "Would you like me to hold your hand?". In this way we can provide some immediate relief
# for caregivers rather than just giving them an app of resources for the future.
