For each of the following words; please answer the following three questions using your own words.

    -   What is it?

    -   What real life thing is it similar to?

    -   When would you use it (what problem does it solve?

1. Variable
    -A variable holds a value that can change and be operated on, e.g. vrble = 0, but then vrble += 5, now vrble is 5.
    -My bank account balance is a variable that stores the amount of money I have and changes as I operate on it by withdrawing and depositing money.
    -We can use a variable to store an initial value and find out what it would be after performing multiple operations on it (e.g. what will my bank balance if I buy a $500 car and pay sales tax on it)
2. Operator
    -Designates a procedural argument that can act upon a variable, e.g. '+' means to add the following argument to the variable.
    -Any action that can be taken to make a change, e.g. I take coffee and then make my coffee += cream and += sugar and then I have delicious_coffee.
    -Whenever you want to change or manipulate values.
3. Assignment Operator
    -Designates a name that will be used to store a variable.
    -My name, 'Brandon Green', is an assignment operator that designates my instance of the human class.
    -When I want to use shorthand to do anything with variables, so that I don't have to repeat myself and can use a single word to access a huge set of variables like my address, phone number, blood-type, level of awesomeness.
4. String
    -A series of letters and characters that represent human-readable words and text.
    -Sentences, words, punctuation, paragraphs, etc.
    -To store human words and text in order to operate on it with the computer.
5. Float
    -A non-whole integer or number with a decimal place.
    -A number with a decimal place, or abstract numbers (I have $14.51) instead of I have one $10 bill, four $1 bills, etc.
    -Whenever we are doing math that should not be rounded to the nearest integer.  As much as I would love a $19.90 in change to come in a $20 bill, the restraunt wouldn't.
6. Boolean
    -A variable that must be equal to either True or False, no truthy or falsey or fence-sitting booleans.
    -Alive or Dead, On or Off, Legal Age to Vote (age >= 18), etc.
    -To check zero-sum situations.  Either someone is old enough to vote, or they or not.  Sarte and logical positivism have no sway here.
7. List
    -A collection of discrete values.
    -The contents of my backpack, e.g. backpack_inventory = ['keys', 'laptop', 'pens', 'penguins']
    -When we want to operate on a group of things, like track what is in my backpack after the penguins migrate away but I replace them with teacup pigs.
8. Dict
    -A collection of key/value pairs.
    -A list of movie reviews, with the title as the key (e.g. 'Gladiator') to access that movie's review (e.g. 'Best movie ever, "THEN LET HIM KILL COMMODUS!"')
    -Store a collection of objects with lots of properties but don't have a particular iterable order.
9. Conditional Expression/Operator
    -A check to perform an operation given a certain boolean state.
    -If hungry: eat  Else: learn code
    -Any kind of complex decision making process, e.g. I will go to the movies If raining == False && Tuesday $5 dollar movie night == True
10. Function
    -A reusable piece of code that takes argument(s) and gives back a result of acting out instructions on that argument.
    -A microwave take a food and time argument and returns a nuked version of that food, changing my frozen_brick into delicious pot_pie
    -Whenever you want to reuse some operation.
11. Argument
    -Objects and values that can be passed to a function.
    -The numbers you press on a calculator and the operator you can tell them to perform, e.g. telling a calculator 4+4 gives it three arguments.  A number, the addition operation, and another number.
    -Any procedure you can define may then be passed valid arguments for computation.
12. Return Value
    -The value or object that will be spit out by a function at the end of operations.
    -The numbers you are given after passing arguments to a calculator, e.g. 4+4 will return the value 8.
    -Saving the result of a complex function so you can then manipulate it in some other way, like passing it to another function.
