    <span>Reduce your energy consumption at home by remotely or locally monitoring and managing your lights & devices with the mobile app, handheld remote, or a computer. Effortlessly monitor what's on in your home and get notifications when lights or outlets are activated.</span>
    <span>With the intuitive and easy to use app, you can easily setup and control your lights and devices while at home or away. When at home, use the handheld remote to activate devices and make things even easier by leaving your phone in your pocket. You can also easily setup and adjust schedules for lights and devices to turn on & off only when you really need them, or based on sunrise and sunset times.</span>
    <span>Kasia is the most cost effective solution on the market, allowing users to control more devices at a fraction of the cost. Kasia devices are designed to do what they do best instead of trying to be a clunky all in one solution. This keeps you from buying unneeded functionality.</span>
