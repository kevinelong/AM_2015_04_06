            <b>Student Bio:</b><br>
            I'm an aspiring developer that has moved across the country from Georgia to take part in this
            class. I have always had an interest in all things electronic, but recently realized that my
            passion was with developing. I spent 13 years as an IT professional.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Student Goals:</b><br>
            My goal is to find a great company in the Portland area to develop for. My wife and I have
            always wanted to live on the west coast, preferably here in Portland. Now we have a baby
            daughter that we definitely want to raise here.
